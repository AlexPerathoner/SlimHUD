## Contributing to SlimHUD
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
<br>The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SlimHUD.

#### Reporting an issue
- Always create **one issue** per bug
- Always ensure that you are using the **latest version** of SlimHUD
- If possible attach the **crash report** found in ```~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/```

#### Submitting changes
Try to make your code as **readable** as possible by:

- Indenting with tabs;
- Putting spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3] not [1,2,3]) and around operators ( c = a + b not c=a+b);
- Using common sense.
