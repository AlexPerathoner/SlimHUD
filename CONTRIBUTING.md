## Contributing to SlimHUD
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
<br>The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SlimHUD.

#### Adding features
- Suggestions are always welcome! Please create an issue and describe your idea, or even better, create a pull request with your implementation.
- Please add some tests for your feature. If you are not sure how to do that, please create an issue and I will help you.
- Make sure that the pre-existing tests are still passing.
- Please make sure that your code is readable. *"Better to have some more lines, than a single line that is hard to understand."*

#### Reporting bugs
- Always create **one issue** per bug
- Check if the issue has already been reported
- Always ensure that you are using the **latest version** of SlimHUD
- If possible attach the **crash report** found in ```~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/```
- Please write:
    - which **OS X version** you are using
    - the resolution of your display
    - the **model** of your Mac (in particular if its a Silicon Mac)
    - if you are using multiple displays
